# 1. Problem Statement
The task is to develop a distributed chatbot system capable of facilitating real-time communication between users and a server. This system should use parallel and distributed computing concepts to handle multiple users, secure their communication, and implement basic fault tolerance. The chatbot should be designed with scalability in mind, capable of handling increasing numbers of concurrent users and requests.
The main challenges addressed by this system include:
## •	Efficiently managing multiple client connections simultaneously.
## •	Ensuring secure communication between the client and server.
## •	Implementing a fault-tolerant system that can handle client disconnections or server errors without affecting overall service continuity.
## •	Distributing tasks across multiple processes or servers to enhance system scalability and performance.
